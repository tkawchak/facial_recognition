# FACIAL RECOGNITION

This is a project using keras and tensorflow to recognize my face in images.  The project involves processing my own image data of my faces and pictures that are not my faces, and then training them on a convolutional neural network.  The results can be seen by looking at the jupyter notebooks.  I have not uploaded data yet since it contains my own personal pictures but I plan to show the directory structure for images.
